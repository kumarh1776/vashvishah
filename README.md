# HAPPY BIRTHDAY! HERE'S SOME HOMEWORK! 

hey bud,

happy twenty first. i think it's egregious that you are an adult right now - we are the same age! i have way too much love for you (like a LOT. you are one of the most pure people i've gotten to know), so it sucks (for me, probably not for you) that i'm not there to celebrate with you.

but instead, i am giving you homework. you've been working on various projects forever (starting with the famed musical instruments of the gold award), so now it's time to showcase it to the world! hopefully this'll help you on your path towards product/UX design and creating dope stuff. 

i snagged you this domain, so now it's up to you. make your own website and let us all see your stuff :) 

much love dude & happy twenty first!
